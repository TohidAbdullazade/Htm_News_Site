            Metsamor NPP poisons Igdir

              The Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant in Armenia, which has not stopped
              operating despite the end of its useful life, continues to emit
              poison in the direction of Turkey's Igdir province. This is
              reported in the material of Ihlas News Agency. It is emphasized
              that the Metsamor NPP, located 16 kilometers from Igdir, has not
              been closed even though its operational period has ended.
              Residents of the district, who knew that it was located on the
              earthquake line, asked for help from the relevant institutions.
              The people of Igdir state that even the smoke from the NPP harms
              them, the geography of the region, and every living thing living
              here. Serdar Unsal, chairman of the Igdir Azerbaijan House
              Association, stated that Metsamor is a "tipped bomb", and stated
              that the NPP located near Igdir should be closed as soon as
              possible. "Because it was made with an outdated system. Since it
              is an old system, its cooling is carried out through the Araz
              river. In addition, its uranium is flown in from Russia. However,
              Metsamor's greatest danger is its location on the 2nd degree
              earthquake line. The station was seriously damaged in 1988 as a
              result of the earthquake in Armenia. One of its units was hastily
              closed and concrete was poured on it. At that time, Igdir was also
              affected by radiation. We are still seeing the damage. Women can't
              get pregnant, animals give birth to crippled cubs, trees wither.
              Today, if you walk around the Metsamor Nuclear Power Station, you
              will see that nature has changed and the greenery has disappeared.
              Therefore, this NPP is a great threat to Turkey, Azerbaijan,
              Russia, Georgia, Iran and Armenia itself. We call on the entire
              European Union, the United States and all activists to support us
              to close this power plant," said Unsal. It should be noted that
              although Metsamor Nuclear Power Station, whose construction began
              in 1970, was closed in 1988 after the Spitak earthquake, reactor
              number 2 was restarted in 1995 after repair work. The operational
              period of the reactor ended in 2005, but as a result of the
              repairs carried out in August 2021, its operational period was
              extended until 2026.
